# Friends Website

This was my **first HTML/CSS project**, created as an introductory assignment during a front-end bootcamp.  
Instead of a generic page, I decided to build a tribute to one of my favorite shows: ***Friends***.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal was to practice the basics of HTML and CSS — layout, styling, images, links — while keeping it personal and fun.  
I used this opportunity to showcase my favorite characters, episodes, and scenes from the show.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS

## 📺 Features

- A short introduction to main characters  
- A list of my favorite episodes  
- One of my all-time favorite scenes  
- A custom hover effect for character descriptions (using CSS only)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring content semantically using HTML  
- Basic CSS layout and hover styling  
- How to make even the simplest website feel personal and expressive

## 💬 Why This Project Matters

This wasn’t just an assignment — it was a way to mix something I enjoy with something I’m learning.  
It's a small site, but it reflects my ability to apply new skills in a way that means something to me.
